# ✅ Advanced React Todo App

A full-featured, business-logic-focused **Todo Application** built with **React**, utilizing **Context API** and **Local Storage** for persistent state, designed to handle real-world use cases beyond the typical "basic todo".

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Add todos with custom text (e.g., YouTube titles, short ideas like Twitter)
- 📝 Edit existing todos in-place
- ✅ Mark todos as completed (with strikethrough effect)
- ❌ Delete individual todos
- 💾 Persistent storage using **LocalStorage** (no data loss on refresh or close)
- 📱 Responsive layout
- 🧠 **Context API** for centralized state management
- ⚙️ Clean separation of logic and UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** 18+
- **Context API**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Local Storage API**
- **Vite** for fast bundling
- **Basic CSS** (UI is secondary to logic)


## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Building functional apps with real-world business logic  
- Using **Context API** to avoid prop drilling  
- Persisting state across refresh using **localStorage**  
- Managing UI state like edit mode, input control, completed status  
- Clean, modular component structure  
- Balancing functionality first, UI second  

## 📝 Todo Flow

1. **Add** a new todo from the input field.  
2. Click ✅ to **complete** a todo (crossed-out text).  
3. Click ✏️ to **edit** an existing task inline.  
4. Click ❌ to **delete** a specific task.  
5. Refresh or close the tab — **todos persist**.  

## ❗ Why This Isn't Just a "Simple Todo App"

While many treat todo apps as beginner-level, this project includes:

- Persistent state management  
- Controlled component design  
- Real-time updates and conditional rendering  
- Efficient **localStorage** syncing  
- Clean code structure for scalability  

## 📱 Responsive Design

Works smoothly across screen sizes.  
Mobile usability considered, though not the design focus.
